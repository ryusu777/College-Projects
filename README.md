  3.	After the employee’s data is added, we must add book’s data. Input “y” to add book’s data, then input book’s title, required age for the book, and current stock.
  4.	The book’s data will be shown. Input “y” to add the book’s data.
  5.	The last step is to add member’s data. Input “y” to add the member’s data then input the member’s name, address, phone number, and age.
